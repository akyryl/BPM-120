# BPM-120
Remember the moment when during the important concert you started playing a music piece in a wrong tempo? It has happened to every professional musician, and it is over eventually!  Meant for professional musicians, it is the on-stage metronome that reminds the tempo of a piece being played live on stage. There is a mute mode that allows to do it discreetly while preparing to start another piece. Whether you are a solo musician, member of a band or a conductor, this app will be incredibly useful for you.  Also, the application is available for Apple Watch, which makes it even more convenient. A phone version of the app can be used just as a usual metronome during your daily practice.  You can create and edit your own concert playlist from your mobile, and all your changes will be instantly available on the watch.
